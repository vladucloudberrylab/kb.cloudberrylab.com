## Problem

Image-based (previously called Bare Metal) backup plan is designed to help customers protect their Windows computers. It integrates with Microsoft VSS technology (Windows Shadow copy) and guarantees transactionally consistent backup. It allows administrators to exclude from backups unwanted files from partitions as well as partitions themselves.
Backup can be restored as an EC2 instance (AWS Virtual Machine), but having partitions of over 1Tb can prevent this action and cause the following error message in the CloudBerry Backup console (or log files): selected partitions exceed 1TB in size. This is an artificial limitation due to the nature of the restoration procedure.

## Resolution

There are several scenarios, all of which are based on the CloudBerry restoration options.

### Scenario 1

#### You have Image Based backup with boot disk over 1 Tb.

CloudBerry Restore plan can be configured with partitions resize and files / folders exclude. Both options allows to shrink target EBS volume to the size AWS can accept through the method we use for the restore. Follow the below instructions to decrease the amount of data to include into restored disk:

In the restore wizard, on the "Select Partitions" make the following changes:

This step contains hidden options to 1) resize target partition; 2) exclude files / folders;
Resize your partition to 1Tb maximum (content exclusion can be helpful to exclude unnecessary data for system boot).

Afterward, just follow the wizard and launch the restoration process. This will launch the EC2 instance with your OS inside.

### Scenario 2

#### You have an image-based backup data disk (with no OS) over 1Tb.

This scenario requires the EC2 instance with Windows OS to be launched in AWS Cloud. This scenario also requires the CloudBerry Backup product to be installed on this Guest OS. Once done, sync your repository according to [this article](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/how-to-continue-backup-on-another-computer/) in our blog. Those steps allow you to have your backup data listed in the newly installed CloudBerry Backup. This should be image-based backup (so make sure you configure your storage account and select backup prefix accordingly). AWS EBS volume supports volumes ranging from 1 to 16384 GiB.

Create a volume that can fix your data and attach it to your EC2 instance. Next step is to restore the disk from the image-based backup as "Physical disk". Hit "Restore", select the storage account with the image-based backup, select other options accordingly (e.g. restoration point, plan name, etc.). Make sure you select "Restore as physical disk" at the  "Type of data" step to restore.

Select partitions to restore and set the destination.

Complete the wizard and start the plan.
