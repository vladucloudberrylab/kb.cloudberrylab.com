## Problem
Let's say, you already have one copy of your image in the cloud and you need to perform a restore as Azure VM. You selected the data for restore, account but you can not choose some of your resources: you can not list your network, subnet, storage and/or your container(s).

What can be a reason of this?

## Reasons and Resolutions
* <u>First reason:</u> specified location.

Make sure that you've set the right region (where you have all your resources created). And make sure that the Virtual Network, Storage and Container created in the same region.

* <u>Second reason:</u> you are using Classic Deployment ([Classic Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/)), but not Resource Manager ([New Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/)).

Cloudberry Backup supports only Resource Manager for restoring virtual machines. In case you are using Classic Deployment and you have Virtual Network, Subnets, Storage and Containers created in old portal, you won't be able to list them in Cloudberry restore wizard.

It's not a problem, cause you can log in to the Resource Manager. Then add Storage, Containers and Virtual Network under your resource group. Don't forget that all this resources should be in one location (region). Once you added all needed resources, return back to Cloudberry restore wizard, complete filling the instance details and finish your restore!
