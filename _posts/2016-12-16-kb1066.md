## Problem
Your cloud storage provider sent you monthly bill and detailed explanation what you were charged for.
And surprisigly you realize that storage contains only 60-70% of the entire bill. The rest of that amount you need to pay for requests


## Resolution
In order to have a better visibility on what you consume from storage provider's subscription we've made this setting in our backup agent.<br>

1. Go to the following folder and locate enginesettings.list file.<br>
For standalone backup:<br>
`C:\ProgramData\CloudBerryLab\CloudBerry Backup\enginesettings.list`
<br><br>For Managed backup this will be something different, depending on the name of the product that you made but still it will be in ProgramData folder.
`C:\ProgramData\Company ABC\enginesettings.list`


2. In enginesettings.list you need to put the following text somewhere in the end:<br>
`<LogRequestCountersOnExit>true</LogRequestCountersOnExit>`
<br>This setting works for all backup versions, but starting from Backup 5.4 you can use the following setting:<br>
`<LogRequestsOnExit>true</LogRequestsOnExit>`
 
3. Run backup plan.
 
4. Click on Tools -> Diagnostic -> Open in folder
 
5. Find the latest modified file with .log extension (file name is your backup plan ID).

6. In the end of the file you will see:

`2016-12-15 14:02:35,207 [SERV] [1] NOTICE - Uploaded: 2(769 KB). Deleted: 0. Failed: 0`<br>
`2016-12-15 14:02:35,249 [SERV] [1] NOTICE - Request GET: success 15, failed 0`<br>
`2016-12-15 14:02:35,249 [SERV] [1] NOTICE - Request PUT: success 15, failed 0`<br>
`2016-12-15 14:02:35,249 [SERV] [1] NOTICE - Request HEAD: success 4, failed 0`<br>
`2016-12-15 14:02:35,249 [SERV] [1] NOTICE - Request DELETE: success 15, failed 0`
<br><br>
![](/images/kb1066/backuplog.png)
<br>
Now you can see how many requests have been sent.
