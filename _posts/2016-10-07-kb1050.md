## Problem

You have your Cloudberry Backup for MS Exchange installed on your machine. You are creating the backup plan and receive an error "Connecting to the remote server failed with the following error message: The WinRM client sent a request to an HTTP server and got a response saying the requested HTTP URL was not available" on the step where you should specify the Databases for upload. Like on the screenshot below:

## Resolution

1. Close Cloudberry's client on the computer you are backing up.
2. Edit enginesettings.list (it's located in C:\ProgramData\CloudBerryLab\CloudBerry Backup\) and change:

    &lt;IsExchange2007&gt;false&lt;/IsExchange2007&gt;<br/>to<br/>&lt;IsExchange2007&gt;true&lt;/IsExchange2007&gt;

3. Start the Cloudberry client and run the backup.
