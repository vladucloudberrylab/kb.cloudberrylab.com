## Problem

An SPF record is a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) record that identifies which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain.

The purpose of an SPF record is to prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From addresses at your domain. Recipients can refer to the SPF record to determine whether a message purporting to be from your domain comes from an authorized mail server.

For example, suppose that your domain example.com uses "on-prem" mail server. You create an SPF record that identifies the CloudBerry Lab mail servers as the authorized mail servers for your domain. When a recipient's mail server receives a message from user@example.com, it can check the SPF record for example.com to determine whether it is a valid message. If the message comes from a server other than "on-prem" mail servers listed in the SPF record, the recipient's mail server can reject it as spam.

That's why it is very important to have SPF record in your domain records.

## Resolution

Set the following SPF record to your domain.

~~~
TXT
v=spf1 ip4:50.19.243.6 ~all
~~~

where TXT - domain record type; second line - value of this record; ip4 - IP address of CloudBerry Lab SMTP server;

In case of other records you can use "include" syntax in the following format:

~~~
TXT
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ip4:50.19.243.6 ~all
~~~
