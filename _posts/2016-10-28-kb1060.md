## Intro
Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, allowing you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment and run your image using as many or as few systems as you desire.

With Cloudberry Backup it is possible to protect yourself from the scenario when your system fails. We call it Disaster Recovery. Just have at least one copy of your system in the backup destination and proceed with restore as an EC2 instance.

Many of our customers ask us, "Is it possible to restore my Windows 7, or my Windows 8, or other OS as an EC2 instance?" And the answer is Yes! Follow the steps below and spin up your desktop OS in the cloud.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you should be aware of some limitations and steps without which it would be impossible to import your desktop OS to AWS environment:

* Don't forget about the role of [VMimport](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/how-to-configure-vmimport-role/)  in your AWS account.
* VM Import/Export supports importing Windows instances with the following file systems: MBR-partitioned volumes that are formatted using the NTFS file system and GUID-Partition-Table-partitioned volumes are not supported.     
* Your Windows instance should be BIOS-booted. Currently, Amazon EC2 service doesn't have an option to enable UEFI booting of instances.
* And, last but not least, you should know that during the restoration process you must select the "Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)" option. It will create an AMI in your AWS account before launching an EC2 instance.

## Restore your Windows7/Windows8/Windows10 as EC2
* Click **Restore** , select "Restore as Amazon EC2 Instance" and <u>don't forget</u> to enable "Create AMI (Amazon Machine Image)" option

* Once your EC2 Instance is restored, you can check created AMI and your restored virtual machine in your AWS account

## Resume
Now you can restore not only Server versions of OS as EC2 with Cloudberry, but you can restore Windows7 / Windows8 / Windows10 as well. Cloudberry always tries to fit the latest updates in the cloud world. According to the AWS [documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html?shortFooter=true#prerequisites-image), you can use a bunch of operating systems that can be imported to EC2.

In this topic we are talking about Desktop OS versions. Here at Cloudberry we have tested the restore with Windows7(x64), Windows8(x64) and Windows10(x64).

Just don't forget that:
1. Your system must be BIOS booted;
2. Your volumes must be MBR-partitioned;
3. You need choose "Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)" option. Otherwise you will get "ClientError: Unsupported Windows OS".
