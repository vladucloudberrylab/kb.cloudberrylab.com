## Intro
Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, allowing you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment and run your image using as many or few systems as you desire.

With Cloudberry Backup it's possible to protect your-self from the scenario when your system fails. We call it Disaster Recovery. Just have at least one copy of your system in the backup destination and proceed with restore as an EC2 instance.

Many of our customers ask us "Is it possible to restore my Windows 7, or my Windows 8, or other as an EC2 instance?" And the answer is YES! Following the steps below allow you to spin up your desktop OS in the cloud.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin you should be aware of some limitations and steps without which it's not possible to import your desktop OS to AWS environment.

* Don't forget about [VMimport](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/how-to-configure-vmimport-role/) role in your AWS account.
* VM Import/Export supports importing Windows instances with the following file systems: MBR-partitioned volumes that are formatted using the NTFS file system. GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioned volumes are not supported.     
* Your Windows instance should be BIOS booted. Currently, Amazon EC2 service doesn't allow an option to enable UEFI booting of instances.
* And the last but no the least point is that during the restore process, you must choose "Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)" option. It will create an AMI in your AWS account before launching of an EC2 instance.

## Restore your Windows7/Windows8/Windows10 as EC2
* Hit "Restore" button, choose "Restore as Amazon EC2 Instance" and (!) <u>don't forget</u> (!) to enable "Create AMI (Amazon Machine Image)" option

* Or you can choose an easier way

* Specify your target EC2 instance details

* Once your EC2 Instance is restored, you can check created AMI and your restored virtual machine in your AWS account

## Resume
Now you can restore not only Server versions of OS as EC2 with Cloudberry. But you can restore Windows7/Windows8/Windows10 as well. Cloudberry always tries to fit the latest updates in the cloud world. According to the AWS [documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html?shortFooter=true#prerequisites-image) you can use a bunch of operating systems that can be imported to EC2.

In this topic we are talking about Desktop OS versions. We here in Cloudberry have tested the restore with Windows7(x64), Windows8(x64) and Windows10(x64).

Just don't forget that:
1. Your system must be BIOS booted;
2. Your volumes must be MBR-partitioned;
3. You need choose "Create an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)" option. Otherwise you will get "ClientError: Unsupported Windows OS".

Download the Cloudberry Backup and give it a try!
