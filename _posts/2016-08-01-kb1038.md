## Problem

When trying to sign in to Cloudberry Backup client downloaded from MBS getting the following error:

![Cloudberry Backup - invalid username or password](/images/mbs-invalid-username.jpg)

This is because the username and password are taken from Admin section rather Users. However there might be username or password mistype (double check your data).

## Resolution

All users for Cloudberry Backup clients should be either created or approved (when using AD bridge) through «Users» section pictured below.
